# Artifact Generator

This tool generates deployable artifacts for various programming languages
(e.g. NPM Node modules for Javascript, JARs for Java, assemblies for C#, etc.).
These artifacts contain source files defining programming-language constants
for the terms (e.g. the Classes and properties) found in RDF vocabularies (such
as Schema.org, or FOAF, or our own custom vocabularies).


# Prerequisites

## npm

To install the Artifact Generator you will need `npm`, if you don't already have
it.

We highly recommend the use of node version manager (nvm) to manage multiple
versions of npm and also set to up your npm permissions properly. To install
nvm, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-node-js-and-npm).

**Note on `npm` permissions:**

If you do not use `nvm`, and you try to install the Artifact Generator globally,
then you may receive **EACCES** permission errors, or other permission-related
errors, when trying to run `npm install -g`.

Please refer to this npm [document](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally)
on how to set your permissions correctly.

# Quick start

---
**__Temporarily__**, until we release the Artifact Generator to the public NPM 
repository, we manually reference the inrupt Verdaccio registry.
---

Install globally (so you can run the Artifact Generator from any directory):
```shell
npm -g install @lit/artifact-generator --registry https://verdaccio.inrupt.com
```

Ensure the installation completed successfully: 
```shell
lit-artifact-generator --help
```

Run the generator using a public demo vocabulary, in this case a simple Pet
Rock vocabulary, telling it not to prompt us for any input (i.e. `--noprompt`):

```shell
lit-artifact-generator generate --inputResources https://team.inrupt.net/public/vocab/PetRock.ttl --noprompt
```

This should generate a Javascript artifact inside the default `Generated`
directory that provides constants for the things described within the Pet Rock
vocabulary.

We can now use this Javascript artifact directly in our applications, both
NodeJS and browser. For example, for NodeJS create this simple `package.json`
that references the local Pet Rock artifact we just generated:

```javascript
{
  "name": "LIT-Artifact-Generator-Demo",
  "description": "Tiny demo application using generated Javascript artifact from a custom Pet Rock RDF vocabulary.",
  "license": "MIT",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "mock-local-storage": "^1.1.8",
    "@lit/generated-vocab-pet-rock": "file:Generated/SourceCodeArtifacts/Javascript"
  }
}
``` 

...and create this trivial application as `index.js`:

```javascript
require('mock-local-storage');
const { PET_ROCK } = require('@lit/generated-vocab-pet-rock');

console.log(`What is Pet Rock 'shinyness'?\n`);

console.log(`Our vocabulary describes it as:`);
console.log(`"${PET_ROCK.shinyness.comment}"\n`);

console.log(`Or in Spanish (our Pet Rock vocab has Spanish translations!):`);
console.log(`"${PET_ROCK.shinyness.commentInLang('es')}"`);
``` 

Finally, simply `npm install`...
```shell script
npm install
```

...and run our NodeJS application:
```shell script
node index.js 
```

We should see this output:
```
[demo]$ node index.js 
What is Pet Rock 'shinyness'?

Our vocabulary describes it as:
"How wonderfully shiny a rock is."

Or in Spanish (our Pet Rock vocab has Spanish translations!):
"Qu√© maravillosamente brillante es una roca."
[demo]$ 
```

# The details

For example, the generator might produce the following Javascript constant to
represent the `Person` class from Schema.org (i.e. `https://schema.org/Person`):
```javascript
    /**
     * A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).
     */
    Person: new LitVocabTerm(_NS('Person'), localStorage, true)
      .addLabel('en', `Person`)
      .addComment('en', `A person (alive, dead, undead, or fictional).`),
```

NOTE: This example shows that we've generated a Javascript `Person` object that
also provides access to the Label and Comment as defined by Schema.org. We've
also used the Comment value as the JSDoc for this `Person` object, meaning
users of this artifact will have helpful documentation available directly in
their IDE.    

The generator can create source-code for Classes and Properties found in
existing online vocabularies today (e.g. Schema.org, FOAF, VCard, GConsent,
etc.), or from local vocabularies (for example local Turtle files).

It also allows aspects of vocabulary terms (e.g. a term's `rdfs:label`, or 
`rdfs:comment`) to be overridden with new values (e.g. if you don't like
Schema.org's label for the property `givenName`, then you can define your own
value of `Given name` to override it). Or you may wish to include new
translations for existing labels or comments (e.g. to provide a Spanish
`rdfs:comment` for Schema.org's `Person` class, say **'Una persona (viva,
muerta, no muerta o ficticia)'**).

Another useful feature is the ability to select only specific terms from an
existing vocabulary. For instance, Schema.org today defines almost 2,000 terms.
But perhaps you only want to use 20 of those terms in your application. To do
this, we can simply define our own local vocabulary that lists those 20 terms
we want, and specify that when running our generator using the
`--termSelectionResource` command-line argument (see examples below).

Putting this all together, we can very easily create our own vocabularies in
any standard W3C serialization of RDF (e.g. Turtle, JSON-LD, N-Triples, etc.),
and immediately allow our developers use the terms in those vocabularies
directly in their development IDE's (with full code-completion and live
JSDoc/JavaDoc). 

And we can easily reuse existing vocabularies, or just the parts of those
vocabularies we wish to use, while also being able to easily extend them, for
example to add our own translations, or override some, or all, of their
existing `labels` or `comments`.

Ultimately, perhaps the biggest benefit of the artifact generator is that it
allows us easily define our own vocabularies in interoperable RDF that can be
easily used, shared and evolved by our existing development teams.

# How to build

Temporarily, until we release the `lit-vocab-term` library to the public NPM
repository, we need our local NPM to point at the inrupt Verdaccio instance to
find this dependency.

```shell
npm set registry https://verdaccio.inrupt.com
```

```shell
npm install
```

Or to install globally (so you can run the generator from any directory):
```shell
npm -g install @lit/artifact-generator
```


# How to run

To ensure the installation was completed successfully: 
```shell
lit-artifact-generator --help
```

## To generate source code from a vocabulary:
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources <vocab resources (e.g. local
 files, or remote IRI's)>
```

The output is a NodeJS Module containing a Javascript file with constants
defined for the RDF terms found in the vocabulary (or multiple vocabularies)
specified by the `--inputResources` flag. This module is located inside the
**./generated** directory by default. To generate artifacts in a different
programming language, a YAML configuration file must be used (see below).

For example:
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources ./demo/vocab/PetRocks.ttl
```
this will generate a Javascript artifact in




## To initialize a YAML file that should be edited manually
```shell
node index.js init
```

The output is a YAML file (by default `./lit-vocab.yml`), within which options can be specified to generate artifacts in different languages (e.g. Java, Javascript, Typescript, etc.) from a list of vocabularies. 

## **validate** a YAML file after it has been manually edited:
```shell
node index.js validate --vocabListFile <./path/to/the/yaml/file>
```
This command verifies that:
- the YAML file is syntactically valid, 
- the mandatory options are specified
- the vocabularies listed in the configuration are accessible and syntactically valid

## **generate** source code from a YAML config file
To generate from **multiple vocabularies**, and/or generate artifacts that are **not Node modules**, you can use a YAML config file: 
```shell
node index.js generate --vocabListFile <./path/to/the/yaml/file>
```

The details of the available options are listed in the [dedicated section of the documentation](#yaml)

## **watch** a set of vocabularies
This command starts a daemon that continuously watches a list of vocabularies, and re-generates artifacts accordingly, you can use the following command:
```shell
node index.js watch --vocabListFile <./path/to/the/yaml/file>
```

The process will run in the foreground until you hit "Enter", and artifacts will be kept up-to-date with vocabularies as long as the daemon is running.

## See the help
```shell
node index.js --help
```
Will list all the available commands (e.g. `generate`, `init`, `validate`, or `watch`), and the options available for each command.

# Advanced configuration

## CLI Examples

Here are some examples of running the tool using the Command Line Interface (CLI) options:

Local vocabulary file

```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources ./example/PetRocks.ttl
```

Remote vocabulary file

```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources https://schema.org/version/latest/schema-snippet.ttl
```

Multiple local vocabulary files:

```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources ./example/Skydiving.ttl ./example/PetRocks.ttl
```

Selecting only specific terms from a vocabulary.
Here we provide the full Schema.org vocab as input, but we only want constants for the handful of terms in the 'just-the-terms-we-want-from-schema-dot-org.ttl' vocab):
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources https://schema.org/version/latest/schema-snippet.ttl --vocabTermsFrom ./example/just-the-terms-we-want-from-schema-dot-org.ttl
```

Collecting multiple (remote in this example) vocabularies into one bundled vocab artifact:
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources  http://schema.org/Person.ttl https://schema.org/Restaurant.ttl https://schema.org/Review.ttl
```

Providing the version for the output module:
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl# ./vocabs/owl-inrupt-ext.ttl --artifactVersion 1.0.1
```

Specifing a custom prefix for the output module name:
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources ./vocabs/schema-snippet.ttl --moduleNamePrefix my-company-prefix-
```

Specifing a custom NPM registry to where the output module will be published:
```shell
node index.js generate --inputResources ./vocabs/schema-snippet.ttl --npmRegistry http://my.company.registry/npm/
```

Using short-form alaises for the command-line flags:
```shell
node index.js generate --i ./vocabs/schema-snippet.ttl --vtf ./vocabs/schema-inrupt-ext.ttl --av 1.0.6 --mnp my-company-prefix-
```

Providing the version for the LIT Vocab Term dependency (this is the library that provides a simple class to represent a vocabulary term (such as a Class, a Property or a Text string)):

*NOTE:* If you're using a local copy of this library, you can also use the form `file:/my_local_copy/lit-vocab-term` to pick up that local copy.
```shell
node index.js generate --i ./vocabs/schema-snippet.ttl --litVocabTermVersion ^1.0.10
```

For help run:
```shell
node index.js --help
```

## <a id="yaml"/> Configuring options using the YAML file

Once you've created a YAML configuration file using `node index.js init`, you can add information about the artifacts you want to generate, and the vocabularies you want to use. 

### Artifacts information

Each artifact to generate (e.g. Java JAR, NPM module, etc.) is configured individually as an entry in the `artifactToGenerate` list.

- Options shared across **all programming languages**:
  - Mandatory:
    - `programmingLanguage`: Supported values `Java`, `Javascript`
    - `artifactVersion`: The version of the generated artifact. Be aware that versioning policies differ depending on the package manager (e.g. NPM does not allow re-publication of the same version, while maven does)
    - `litVocabTermVersion`: The version of the library LIT Vocab Term library (e.g. https://github.com/inrupt/lit-vocab-term-js for Javascript, https://github.com/pmcb55/lit-java/tree/master/lit-vocab-term for Java) upon which the generated vocabularies will depend
    - `artifactDirectoryName`: Name of the directory in which the artifacts are stored, child of the output directory of the generation process
    - `handlebarsTemplate`: Template used to generate the source files from the vocabulary data
    - `sourceFileExtension`: Extension added to the generated source files
  - Optional
    - `languageKeywordsToUnderscore`: List of terms defined by the vocabulary that are keywords of the target language, and which will generate corresponding constant names prefixed with an underscore to prevent compiler errors.'
    - `repository`: Artifact repository to which the artifacts may be published.
    - `gitRepository`: Address of the git repository.
- **Language-specific** options
  - Javascript
    - `npmModuleScope`: useful for publication on NPM
  - Java
    - `javaPackageName`: Package name shared by all the generated vocabularies of the artifact

### Vocabulary information

Information about each vocabulary is an object in the list `vocabList`.

- Mandatory:
  - `inputResources`: A list of resources, which can be any mixture of local RDF files (whose path may be absolute, or relative to the YAML file itself) or remote IRI's, from which a single vocabulary source file will be generated.
- Optional:
  - `nameAndPrefixOverride`: The name of the generated vocabulary. For instance, if set to `foo`, the corresponding Java class will be `FOO.java`. If not set, the generator will look in the source RDF vocabulary for the `vann:preferredNamespacePrefix` property, and if it is not defined it will propose a default based on the domain name. This defaut is composed of the complete domain name, excluding the country extension, e.g. `http://vocab.example.org/` would default to `vocab.example`.
  - `description`: A description of the vocabulary, that will be used as a comment describing the generated class
  - `termSelectionFile`: When using only a portion of a large vocabulary, this option specifies a second input vocabulary that defines the subset of terms that are to be generated from the `inputResources`. Moreover, it also enables adding custom information to a vocabulary you don't have control over (e.g. adding translations for existing labels or comments, or overriding existing values, or adding completely new terms, etc.)

# How to build and deploy the module to an npm registry

When you run the tool you will be prompted with questions that will quide you through the process. Here are the list of questions:

1. Artifact name (Enter for default)
2. Artifact author (Enter for default)
3. Current artifact version in registry is x.x.x. Do you want to bump the version?
   - patch
   - minor
   - major
   - no
4. Do you want to publish {artifact name} to the registry {registry}? (y/N)

Here is an example of what this will look like on the output:
```shell
[lit-artifact-generator-js]$ node index.js generate --inputResources ./vocabs/schema-snippet.ttl --vocabTermsFrom ./vocabs/schema-inrupt-ext.ttl
? Artifact name ... @lit/generated-vocab-schema-inrupt-ext
? Artifact author ... Jarlath Holleran
Created artifact: [./generated/index.js]
Created artifact: [./generated/package.json]
? Current artifact version in registry is 1.0.1. Do you want to bump the version? patch
Artifact (@lit/generated-vocab-schema-inrupt-ext) version has been updated (patch).
? Do you want to publish @lit/generated-vocab-schema-inrupt-ext to the registry http://localhost:4873? Yes

```

**Note**: By default this will *only* publish to the NPM registry at http://localhost:4873 (I'm running Verdaccio on my local 
machine). You can configure the registry on the command line arguments (npmRegistry).

**Note**: Make sure that you have incremented the version of the module so that it can published.


# Creating extension file

The idea behind extension files is to allow us 'extend' vocabularies that are already published, or that we don't control. For instance, we may want to extend an existing vocabulary to add our own translations for the labels and comments of terms in that existing vocabulary.

For some examples see: 

- [./vocabs/schema-inrupt-ext.tt](./vocabs/schema-inrupt-ext.ttl)
- [./vocabs/vcard-inrupt-ext.tt](./vocabs/vcard-inrupt-ext.ttl)
- [./vocabs/owl-inrupt-ext.tt](./vocabs/owl-inrupt-ext.ttl)


# Debugging

The code uses the NPM `debug` package for reporting log information during operation. To turn on logging, simply set the `DEBUG` environment variable. For example, to see all logging for all artifact-generator operation, set:

`DEBUG=lit-artifact-generator*`

To only see logging for the `VocabGenerator` component, set:

`DEBUG=lit-artifact-generator:VocabGenerator`

To see logging for the entire operation (including dependencies that also use `debug`), set:

`DEBUG=*`

## IntelliJ

When running tests in IntelliJ, simply edit the 'Run/Debug Configurations' settings to add the appropriate `DEBUG=...` setting in the Environment Variables editbox.
